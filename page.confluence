h1. Tableau Server Backup Automation Using Bash Script

h2. Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to automate the backup process for Tableau Server using a Bash script. The script initiates Tableau's backup command, transfers backup files to an Amazon S3 bucket, and sends notifications via Amazon SNS for backup success or failure.

h2. Prerequisites
* Tableau Server installed and configured.
* AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions.
* Access to an Amazon S3 bucket.
* Understanding of basic Bash scripting.

h2. Step 1: Bash Script Setup
# Create a Bash script file (e.g., "tableau_backup.sh") on your Tableau Server machine.
# Copy the following script into the file:

{code:language=bash}
# Paste the provided script here
{code}

# Replace placeholders with actual values:
** BACKUP_DIR: Local directory path for storing Tableau backup files.
** S3_BUCKET: Destination S3 bucket where backup files will be moved.
** SNS_ARN: ARN of the SNS topic for sending notifications.
** EMAIL_SUBJECT: Subject for notification emails.

h2. Step 2: Schedule Backup
# Make the script executable:
{code}
chmod +x tableau_backup.sh
{code}
# Schedule the script to run at desired intervals using cron or any scheduling tool.

h2. Step 3: Testing
# Manually execute the script to ensure it performs backup and notification tasks correctly:
{code}
./tableau_backup.sh
{code}

h2. Step 4: Documentation
# Document the script's purpose, components, usage, and dependencies.
# Provide clear instructions for modifying and executing the script.
# Include example cron job for scheduling.

h2. Example Cron Job
{code}
# Run backup script every Monday and Friday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 1,5 /path/to/tableau_backup.sh
{code}

h2. Conclusion
Automating Tableau Server backups streamlines data protection and ensures business continuity. By following this guide, you can implement a reliable backup solution tailored to your organization's needs.
