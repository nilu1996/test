Subject: Technical Status Update: Resolution of Worker Autoscaling Error and KMS Key Issue

Team,

Today's technical update involves addressing the worker autoscaling error. While troubleshooting, we encountered an additional challenge related to the KMS key, which was not specified in the CloudFormation Template (CFT). Several unknown errors have surfaced, leading us to reconsider the autoscaling approach for the time being.

Our current strategy involves the creation of a launch template configuration. This will serve as the foundation for our continued efforts to resolve the issues we've identified. Tomorrow, we plan to resume our work and delve deeper into this approach.

To facilitate collaboration and provide real-time updates, we have scheduled a call tomorrow at 9:30 PM GMT. Your participation and insights will be valuable as we navigate through these challenges.
