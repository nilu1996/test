Subject: Request to Remove Unused AWS Resources

Hi Chandan,

I hope you're doing well.

I noticed that we have some AWS resources that we're not using anymore. To save costs and keep things tidy, we should remove them.

Here's a list of the resources that we're not using: [Insert link to the list here]

Can you take a look and let me know when we can remove them?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
