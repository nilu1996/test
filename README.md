Hello Neil and Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to follow up on the connectivity issue between Alteryx HRG and Tableau Server. We are keen to understand the current status of your internal investigation and any progress that has been made.

During our last discussion, you mentioned that your team was looking into the network issue and would update the GBT team upon resolution. We would greatly appreciate any updates you can provide at this time.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
