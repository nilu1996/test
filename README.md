Hello Chandan,

Following our conversation, I've outlined the access control plan for AWS SageMaker's interaction with S3:

1. **Bucket Level Access**:
   Users associated with AWS SageMaker will have full access to the designated S3 bucket, enabling seamless collaboration and data sharing for the projects hosted within.

2. **Object Level Access**:
   For instance, specific users or roles within the SageMaker team will be granted access to particular folders or objects within the S3 bucket, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

To implement this plan:

1. **Bucket Level Access**:
   We'll configure the IAM role used by SageMaker to include permissions granting access to the designated S3 bucket. This involves attaching a policy to the IAM role, allowing the necessary actions on objects within the bucket.

2. **Object Level Access**:
   Based on discussions with the IAM team, it's imperative to establish IAM policies tailored for object-level access control. Each SageMaker user or role will be associated with an IAM role that restricts access to specific folders or objects within the S3 bucket.

Please review the outlined plan and let me know if any modifications are required before initiating the implementation process.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
