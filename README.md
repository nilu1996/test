Hi Nilesh, Adithya
Please use STS token with IAM role for accessing S3 location, Using boto3.

I think we discussed this but was dropped somewhere in priorities. We have certain audits, and this canâ€™t go on so please work on this change on priority.

Following processes are using S3 Secret and access keys:
GTDR Python script
Few WellsFargoBi Lambda functions

All these needs to be updated and use the STS token method.
