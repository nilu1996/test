Subject: Request to Terminate Unused AWS Resources

Hello Chandan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to bring to your attention the presence of certain AWS resources that are currently underutilized and need to be terminated to optimize our cloud infrastructure.

Upon reviewing our AWS environment, it has come to my attention that there are additional resources that are no longer in active use. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage costs and streamline our infrastructure, I kindly request your assistance in identifying and terminating these resources.

Please find below the list of AWS resources that are currently not being utilized:

Best regards,
[Your Name]
