We would like to schedule a call to discuss the proposed changes.

Given that these changes are critical for Tableau Production, we need to first assess their impact. Specifically, we are considering creating a new RDS instance from a snapshot, which will alter the endpoint and associated configuration.

Since we are currently in the migration phase, understanding the impact is crucial before proceeding.

Please provide your availability so that I can arrange the call accordingly.
