If any team member is available for a brief 15-minute discussion today, could we schedule a quick call? Additionally, I have a few technical queries regarding our upcoming upgrade activity that I would appreciate your input on:

What is the anticipated downtime for this upgrade activity?

Given that this is a major version update, is it necessary to first upgrade to an intermediate stable version before transitioning to version 2023.2.1.13, or can we proceed directly to the higher version?

Could you please provide a detailed list of prerequisites that need to be addressed both before and after the upgrade?
