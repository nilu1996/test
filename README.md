Subject: Update on Target Group Registration and Firewall Access Ticket

Dear Team,

I would like to provide an update on our recent activities. We have successfully completed the registration process for the target group. Additionally, I have raised a ticket requesting firewall access for uattableau.amergbt.com to be extended to the public network.

As of now, uattableau.amexgbt.com has not been mapped to Cloudflare. Our team is actively working on this task to ensure proper integration.

I have engaged in a discussion with the firewall team, and they have communicated that the request is currently in progress. We will continue to monitor and update you on the status as developments occur.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Best regards,
