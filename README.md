Subject: AWS SageMaker Integration with Okta and User Restriction Discussion

Dear Chandan,

During today's call, we engaged with the AWS Support ticket team to discuss two key topics. The discussion was structured into two parts, as outlined below:

1. Integration of AWS SageMaker with Okta:
   We are seeking to integrate AWS SageMaker seamlessly into the Okta dashboard, akin to our previous implementation with Redshift. Documentation pertaining to the Redshift integration has been shared for reference. It's worth noting that IDP authentication is currently unavailable for AWS SageMaker. The AWS team has committed to testing and exploring potential solutions, with plans to reconvene for further discussion once their findings are available.

2. User Restriction Mechanisms:
   We discussed the approach proposed by the AWS team regarding user restriction mechanisms.

We appreciate your attention to these matters and look forward to further collaboration. 

Best regards,
Nilesh
