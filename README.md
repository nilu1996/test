Subject: Cost Analysis for Setting up CloudWatch Dashboard for EC2 Monitoring

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

As requested, I have conducted a cost analysis for setting up a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor our EC2 instances. Below is a detailed breakdown of the expected monthly costs associated with this setup:

EC2 Instance Monitoring Cost Breakdown
EC2 Instance:

Cost: Variable, depending on instance type, size, and region.
IAM Role:

Cost: Free.
Details: IAM is free of charge, but charges may apply for other AWS services accessed via IAM roles.
CloudWatch Agent:

Cost: No additional charge for the CloudWatch agent itself.
Details: Charges are incurred for the metrics collected by the agent.
CloudWatch Metrics:

Cost: $0.30 per metric per month for custom metrics.
Details: We will be collecting 4 CPU metrics and 1 memory metric.
Calculation: 5 metrics (4 CPU + 1 memory) * $0.30 = $1.50 per month.
CloudWatch Dashboard:

Cost: $3.00 per dashboard per month.
Calculation: 1 dashboard * $3.00 = $3.00 per month.
CloudWatch Alarms:

Cost: $0.10 per alarm per month.
Details: 2 alarms set up (one for CPU and one for memory).
Calculation: 2 alarms * $0.10 = $0.20 per month.
SNS (Simple Notification Service) Notifications:

Cost: $0.50 per 1 million Amazon SNS requests, plus $0.06 per 100,000 notifications over HTTP/S, $0.75 per 100 notifications over SMS, and $2.00 per 100,000 email notifications.
Details: Assuming 1,000 email notifications per month.
Calculation: 1,000 notifications * ($2.00 / 100,000) = $0.02 per month.
Total Monthly Cost
Metrics: $1.50
Dashboard: $3.00
Alarms: $0.20
Notifications: $0.02
Estimated Total: $4.72 per month (excluding the EC2 instance cost).

Please note that this cost estimate does not include the variable costs associated with the EC2 instance itself, which depend on the specific instance type, size, and region.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to contact me.
