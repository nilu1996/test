**Subject: Approval Needed to Create VPC Endpoint for SageMaker API**

**Hi Chandan,**

I wanted to update you on an issue we're facing with our JupyterLab setup and request your approval to create a new VPC endpoint to resolve it. Below are the key points from my recent conversation with the AWS team:

1. **Issue Description:**
   - We successfully built a custom container and attached it to our domain.
   - However, we are unable to start the notebook using the custom image due to a 400 Bad Request error when trying to connect to the SageMaker API endpoint.

2. **Cause of the Issue:**
   - The JupyterLab fails to launch with a custom image because it cannot connect to the SageMaker API endpoint ("api.sagemaker.us-east-1.amazonaws.com").
   - The failure occurs when Studio tries to update the space image using the UpdateSpace API, but it receives a 400 Bad Request status code.

3. **Reason for Endpoint Creation:**
   - Our domain is deployed in VPC-only mode, which means it requires a specific VPC endpoint ("com.amazonaws.region.sagemaker.api") to call the UpdateSpace API.
   - Currently, our VPC ("vpc-0e86f92aeebe0b3b2") does not have this required endpoint, causing the connection to fail.

4. **Proposed Solution:**
   - Create a new VPC endpoint for the SageMaker API using the same subnet ("subnet-09997d8d032494830") and security group ("sg-0bfc83c5dd1872949") that our domain uses.

5. **Action Required:**
   - Approval to create the necessary VPC endpoint to resolve the issue and allow the JupyterLab to launch with the custom image.

Creating this endpoint is crucial for the seamless functioning of our custom container in SageMaker. Please let me know if you approve of this setup, and I will proceed accordingly.

Thank you,

Nilesh
