Subject: Discussion Summary: Adding Extra Nodes to Alteryx Production Environment

Hi Chandan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I had a discussion with Paul regarding the enhancement of our Alteryx production environment by adding extra nodes. Paul suggested two potential approaches to address our requirements:

### 1. Increasing Instance Size:
   - Instead of adding two extra nodes, we could increase the instance type from `m6i.2xlarge` to `m6i.4xlarge`.
   - Prior to upgrading the primary node, we need to add the necessary extra licenses. No additional actions are required for the worker nodes.
   - This approach necessitates increasing the instance size of both nodes to ensure optimal performance.

### 2. Adding Extra Nodes:
   - Alternatively, we could proceed with adding two extra nodes. However, this requires modifications to the CloudFormation Template (CFT) used during the initial Alteryx setup.
   - We need to evaluate the potential impact on the application caused by these changes to the CFT.
   - It is crucial to test these changes in a lower environment before implementing them in the production environment to ensure stability and reliability.

Given the complexity of these changes, we will require Paul's support during the implementation phase. His expertise will be invaluable in ensuring a smooth transition and mitigating any potential risks.

Please let me know your feedback on these approaches. Your insights will be instrumental in deciding the best course of action for enhancing our Alteryx production environment.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
