Subject: Technical Updates and Challenges - Action Required

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide some updates on our recent technical endeavors and highlight some ongoing challenges that require our attention.

1. AWS Lifecycle Policy:
   - I've been working on implementing a lifecycle policy for AWS SageMaker service. This policy aims to automatically stop instances when they remain idle for a certain period of time.

2. Jupiter Lab Challenges:
   - Despite our efforts and consultation with AWS support, we're facing challenges with Jupiter Lab scripts that require internet access. Converting these scripts into offline versions has been unsuccessful so far. Additionally, attempts to stop instances using Lambda functions have not yielded desired results.
   - However, we've successfully implemented an offline script for stopping Classic Notebook Instances, and I've documented the process.

3. SAGEMAKER User S3 Bucket Access:
   - Our attempts to implement access policies for Sagemaker S3 buckets have not been fruitful. We're exploring options recommended by AWS, including creating separate execution roles for each user.

4. Creating Folders Inside S3 Bucket:
   - I've tested and documented the process for users to create folders within their designated S3 bucket areas.

5. pyspark Issues:
   - We've encountered issues with pyspark, and while AWS support has suggested installing Java, this requires internet access. Unfortunately, we haven't found a suitable offline script for this yet.

6. Missing Packages on Sagemaker Instances:
   - Work is currently underway to address missing packages when Sagemaker instances are in an offline state.

7. Github Access:
   - I've successfully raised access for Github ad groups and now have access to Github. We're in the process of creating repositories for the team and testing connections.

Action Required:
- I kindly request your assistance and input on the aforementioned challenges, especially those related to offline scripting, S3 bucket access, and package management.
- Please review the documentation provided and share any insights or suggestions you may have to overcome these challenges.

Your collaboration and expertise are greatly appreciated as we work towards resolving these issues and optimizing our technical workflows.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]
