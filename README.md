Subject: Inquiry Regarding Tableau Service Behavior and Best Practices for Instance Management

Dear Peter,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss some recent observations regarding our infrastructure, particularly in the context of managing instances in our lower environments.

While implementing the strategy to keep our instances in a stopped state when not in use, I noticed that the Tableau service automatically starts when the instance is powered on in the morning. I wanted to confirm if this behavior is expected or if it requires further investigation.

Furthermore, as part of our efforts to efficiently manage our resources, we are considering using cron jobs to stop and start the Tableau application along with the instance. I would appreciate your insights on the best practices in this scenario and any recommendations you might have to ensure smooth operation and resource optimization.

Looking forward to your guidance on this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
