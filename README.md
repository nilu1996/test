Hello Peter,

I'm seeking clarification regarding the integration between Tableau and Okta.

Firstly, focusing on Tableau Dev:
We've noticed that we haven't followed step number 3 as outlined in the documentation. Despite this, we're able to log in using email credentials.

Moving on to Tableau UAT:
Here, we've completed step number 3 as specified. Subsequently, we shared the metadata file with the Okta team, who then added assertion details. However, it came to our attention that users were unable to log in using their email IDs. Our documentation indicates that email ID attributes are not supported.

My query is, should we remove the configuration from the Okta side?
If so, I'd like to understand the potential impact of this action on Okta's configuration and any potential future implications.

Looking forward to your guidance on this matter.

Best regards, [Your Name]
