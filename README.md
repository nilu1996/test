Hello Peter,

We are scheduling a Tableau Production server standardization activity for the upcoming Saturday, 3-16-2024. Prior to this, we want to ensure that all necessary preparations are in place. Would it be possible to arrange a call tomorrow at 6:00 PM IST (12:30 PM GMT) to discuss any pre-requisites or considerations? Your insights and expertise would be invaluable in ensuring the smooth execution of this activity.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
