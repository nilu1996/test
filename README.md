Subject: Urgent: Server Onboarding for CyberArk Integration - Ticket [#]

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'd like to bring to your attention an urgent matter regarding the onboarding of servers for integration with CyberArk. As per the ticket reference [#], it's imperative that we proceed swiftly with this setup and the associated changes.

Regarding the standardization of servers, it's crucial to note that, for the time being, we are unable to implement full standardization. However, we have made an exception and had discussions regarding hostname renaming. While we can proceed with installing security tools, it's important to clarify that antivirus installation is not feasible at this point.

Should you require further details or insights on this matter, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position/Department]
