During my discussion with Tanya, she demonstrated the ability to access AWS controls through the OKTA interface, accessible via the right-hand side application panel. Specifically, she was able to locate the Sagemaker tile within the AWS environment. Please verify the access status, and if anyone is still encountering difficulties, kindly inform me. Thank you.
