**Subject: Upgrade of MailScheduler Extension to 3.1.0**

Hello Team,

I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully upgraded the MailScheduler Extension from version 3.0.1 to 3.1.0. I have documented the upgrade steps on our Confluence page. You can find the detailed instructions [here](insert-link).

Regarding the aft-extension, we have four different components running, including Drill and Supertable. Nico is currently uncertain about the upgrade process, and as a result, we are unable to proceed with it at the moment. He is expected to connect with me by Monday, and we will aim to finalize the setup then.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
