Subject: Setup of Python Application on Hive Server

Hi Chandan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I had a discussion with Prakhar regarding the setup of a Python application, which they expect to be operational during IST hours. We propose to set up this application on the Hive server, where Bison is already deployed.

### Expected Work from Our Side:

1. **Setup Application on EC2 Instance:**
   - We will deploy the Python application on an EC2 instance, ensuring it is configured correctly and ready for use.

2. **Setup AWS Lambda to Manage EC2 Instance:**
   - We will configure an AWS Lambda function to automatically turn on the EC2 instance in the morning. This is necessary because our lower environments are turned off during the night to optimize costs.

3. **Setup Bash Script to Initialize the Application:**
   - We will create a bash script that will start the Python application whenever the EC2 instance is powered on. This script will be integrated with the instanceâ€™s startup routine to ensure the application is up and running without manual intervention.

Please let me know your feedback on this plan. Once I have your approval, I will proceed with the implementation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
