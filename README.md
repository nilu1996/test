Subject: Guidance Required for KMS Keys Upgrade for Alteryx Production and Sandbox Accounts

Dear [Recipient's Name],

We are in the process of upgrading KMS keys for both our Alteryx Production and Sandbox accounts. Specifically, we are transitioning from AWS-managed keys to customer-managed keys. This change will enable the CloudOps team to take snapshots of EC2 instances and store them in S3 buckets for extended periods.

To ensure a smooth upgrade, could you please provide any prerequisites or guidelines that we need to follow? Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
