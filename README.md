Sure, here is a more technical version of your message:

Thank you for your feedback. We need to complete this upgrade by the end of this month. 

Before proceeding, we require a comprehensive plan as we have a substantial user base for HRG Alteryx. 

I would like to schedule a call with you to discuss this activity and formulate a detailed plan. If you are unavailable, it would be helpful if someone else from your team could assist us.

We would prefer to have this call today, if possible.

Feel free to adjust any details to better fit your specific needs.
