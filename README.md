Subject: Successful CloudFormation Template Provisioning and Next Steps

Dear Team,

I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully provisioned the CloudFormation template today. All the resources required for both the Development (Dev) and Production (Prod) servers have been created without any issues.

The subsequent step involves the manual configuration of the Windows server. To obtain access to the Windows server, it is imperative to complete the server standardization process first.

Once the standardization process is complete, I will initiate the creation of additional tickets. Subsequently, we can proceed with the manual configuration process.
