Here's a Proof of Concept (POC) outlining the steps to share a file from a local system to an S3 bucket using IAM credentials:

### Proof of Concept (POC): Sharing File from Local to S3 Bucket using IAM Credentials

#### Objective:
Demonstrate the process of securely sharing a file from a local system to an S3 bucket using IAM credentials for authentication.

#### Prerequisites:
1. AWS account with permissions to create resources.
2. IAM user with appropriate permissions to access the target S3 bucket.

#### Steps:

1. **IAM User Setup:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Create a new IAM user with programmatic access:
     - Specify a username and select "Programmatic access".
     - Attach policies granting access to the target S3 bucket (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`).
     - Note down the IAM user's access key ID and secret access key.

2. **S3 Bucket Configuration:**
   - Create or identify the target S3 bucket where you want to upload the file.
   - Ensure that the IAM user has appropriate permissions (e.g., write access) to the S3 bucket.

3. **AWS CLI Installation:**
   - Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local system if not already installed.
   - Configure the AWS CLI with the IAM user's access key ID and secret access key:
     ```
     aws configure
     ```

4. **Upload File to S3:**
   - Use the AWS CLI to upload the file from your local system to the S3 bucket:
     ```
     aws s3 cp /path/to/local/file s3://bucket-name/
     ```

5. **Verification:**
   - Verify that the file has been successfully uploaded to the S3 bucket by navigating to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI:
     ```
     aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/
     ```

#### Conclusion:
This POC demonstrates the straightforward process of securely sharing a file from a local system to an S3 bucket using IAM credentials for authentication. By following these steps, you can effectively upload files to S3 buckets and manage access permissions using IAM users and policies.
