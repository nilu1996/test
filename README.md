Certainly, here's the rephrased version of your request with technical terminology and proper grammar:

---

I require assistance in devising a strategy to manage the lifecycle of Amazon SageMaker Studio instances within our VPC-only environment. Our goal is to automatically halt idle instances after a specified period to optimize cost control. Our current attempts involve scripting solutions that interface with SageMaker API endpoints. However, due to the restricted internet access inherent in our VPC-only setup, these scripts encounter connectivity issues with external APIs.

After engaging with AWS support to mitigate these internet restrictions, we encountered further challenges in the subsequent steps. Therefore, I am seeking alternative methods or scripts that can operate offline, effectively monitoring and stopping idle SageMaker Studio instances within our environment. This approach aims to facilitate cost management without relying on external API calls.
