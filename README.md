This ticket got rejected with Remark:
Please provide hostnames and IP address. This form is unclear. 
As this for tableau server where standardization is not done yet, that the reason I have mention the IP Address.
If I provide Hostname which we have it contain name like: Tableau-Server-dev-Linux-2-Node1. its not standard hostname we follow.
As we know we are not changing hostname of it will causze the problem to server it self.
Help here, I am not sure If I raised with Hostname with have currently its is going to help or not.
