Subject: Technical Discussion on S3 POC Approach

Hi Chandan,

I hope this email finds you well. Today, I had a discussion with the team regarding our S3 Proof of Concept (POC) approach, and I'd like to share the key points with you:

User Restriction:
1. We can implement user restrictions at the bucket level to control access.

Requirements from Our Side:
To proceed with the implementation, we require the following details:
1. ROLE ARN name
2. Destination S3 bucket name
3. AWS Account details

Upload and Download Process:

Uploading Files:
1. Users will receive their username and password from the MFT team to facilitate file uploads.
2. The downloading process will be scheduled. At specific times, the data will be available on the GoAnywhere server.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or if there are any additional details required from your end.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
