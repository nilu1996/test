4. Approach : Using AWS FSx 

1. We can create storage in FSx with help of Cloudops team.
2. Cloudops team will create separate share drive for us using that we can share files easly. 
3. User need to put files in share location this files are accessible directoy from Alteryx servers as well. 
4. We have raised one ticket earlier for this already. # 1343620
