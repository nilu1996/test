Subject: Summary of Alteryx Server Configuration Discussion

Hi Vivek,

I hope this email finds you well. Following my meeting with Raghu, I gathered important information about our current Alteryx server setup:

1. **Okta Configuration Status:**
   We are currently not utilizing any Okta configuration on the existing Alteryx server. Instead, we are employing username-password authentication for logins.

2. **User Groups on Alteryx:**
   For efficient management, we aim to establish two primary groups on Alteryx:
   - *Curator:* Responsible for server administration.
   - *Artisan:* Empowered to publish, run, and share workflows.
   - *Member:* Users in this group can run workflows.

3. **Current User Distribution:**
   - *Curator Group:* Currently has two users.
   - *Member Group:* All other users are part of this group.

4. **Future Access Requests:**
   If there is a need to elevate a Member's access to Artisan in the future, we will handle such requests on a case-by-case basis.

Raghu, please review and let me know if there are any aspects I may have overlooked or if additional assistance is required.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
