## Tableau Server Backup Automation Using Bash Script

### Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to automate the backup process for Tableau Server using a Bash script. The script initiates Tableau's backup command, transfers backup files to an Amazon S3 bucket, and sends notifications via Amazon SNS for backup success or failure.

### Prerequisites
- Tableau Server installed and configured.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions.
- Access to an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Understanding of basic Bash scripting.

### Step 1: Bash Script Setup
1. Create a Bash script file (e.g., `tableau_backup.sh`) on your Tableau Server machine.
2. Copy the following script into the file:

```bash
# Paste the provided script here
```

3. Replace placeholders with actual values:
   - `BACKUP_DIR`: Local directory path for storing Tableau backup files.
   - `S3_BUCKET`: Destination S3 bucket where backup files will be moved.
   - `SNS_ARN`: ARN of the SNS topic for sending notifications.
   - `EMAIL_SUBJECT`: Subject for notification emails.

### Step 2: Schedule Backup
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x tableau_backup.sh
   ```
2. Schedule the script to run at desired intervals using cron or any scheduling tool.

### Step 3: Testing
1. Manually execute the script to ensure it performs backup and notification tasks correctly.
   ```bash
   ./tableau_backup.sh
   ```

### Step 4: Documentation
1. Document the script's purpose, components, usage, and dependencies.
2. Provide clear instructions for modifying and executing the script.
3. Include example cron job for scheduling.

### Example Cron Job
```
# Run backup script every Monday and Friday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 1,5 /path/to/tableau_backup.sh
```

### Conclusion
Automating Tableau Server backups streamlines data protection and ensures business continuity. By following this guide, you can implement a reliable backup solution tailored to your organization's needs.
