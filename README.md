Hello Team,

We are currently addressing the connectivity issue between Alteryx HRG and Tableau Server. I would like to request a status update on this matter.

During our last discussion, Neil and his team mentioned that they are investigating the network issue internally. They committed to informing the GBT team once a resolution is reached.

Could you please provide an update on the current status of this investigation?

Thank you.
