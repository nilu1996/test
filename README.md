If you anyone of you available today for 15min, Can we connect if possible?

Also please help me with my few querys I have.

1. What is expected downtime for this activity ?

2. As it will be Major version update do we need to jump first some stable version first then go to version 2023.2.1.13
    Or we can jump directly to higher version.

3. Please share pre-requested needed to be done before this upgrade and after this upgrade.
