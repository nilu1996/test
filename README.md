Subject: Technical Update and Questions on Server Onboarding

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. Here's a brief technical update on the ongoing server onboarding process:

1. Server Onboarding on CyberArk:
   The onboarding process on CyberArk is currently underway.

2. Traffic Configuration for Alteryx.exe:
   The next step involves configuring traffic to allow downloads for alteryx.exe.

3. License Update:
   During today's connection, Paul switched the production licenses to temporary licenses.

4. Expected Server Handover:
   We anticipate that the server will be ready for handover by tomorrow morning.

5. Alteryx Production Pending Configurations:
   - SAML Configuration
   - SMTP Configuration

**Questions:**
1. Regarding SMTP configuration, we require an email ID for notifications in both the sandbox and production environments. Could you confirm if there is a specific email ID for this purpose, or should we create a new one?

Your prompt response is appreciated.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
