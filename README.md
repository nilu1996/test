Subject: Assistance Needed with SMTP Configuration Issues

Hi Team,

I trust this message finds you well. We've recently configured a new mail server, focusing on the SMTP server, and encountered a couple of noteworthy points:

1. **Emails from notifications.ame Domain:**
   Emails sent from the notifications.ame domain are encountering issues and not being successfully delivered.

2. **Mail Delivery from notification.amex Domain:**
   While the configuration appears to be correct, we are facing challenges receiving emails sent from the notification.amex domain.

3. **Identification of Blockage:**
   In discussions with the CloudOps team, it has come to light that there may be a blocking issue somewhere in the communication pathway.

We are seeking your insights and assistance in resolving these concerns. Any guidance or recommendations you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
