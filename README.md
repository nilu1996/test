Hi Chandan,

1. I've developed a bash script responsible for creating backups and storing them in an S3 bucket. The script also includes functionality to remove backups from the server that are older than 7 days. I've set up a crontab job to run this script every Friday at 1 AM MST.

2. I've informed the Linux team to initiate the onboarding process for CyberArk and to update the ticket with the relevant details.
