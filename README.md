Sure, I can help you set up a monthly disk and CPU utilization report from Redshift and share it over email. Additionally, I can provide stats on the total number of queries submitted in a month and identify the user who fired the maximum number of queries. Here's a high-level plan to achieve this:

1. **Monthly Disk and CPU Utilization Report:**
   - Set up a Redshift query to gather disk and CPU utilization metrics for each day of the month.
   - Create a SQL query that aggregates these metrics to provide monthly statistics.
   - Schedule this SQL query to run on the last day of each month using a cron job or a scheduling tool like Airflow.
   - Save the query results to a CSV file or a temporary table in Redshift.

2. **Email Distribution:**
   - Write a script (e.g., using Python) to read the CSV file or query the temporary table and format the data into an email-friendly format.
   - Use an email library (e.g., smtplib) to send the formatted report via email.
   - Schedule this script to run after the Redshift query job completes, ensuring it's triggered on the first day of the following month.

3. **Total Queries Submitted:**
   - Utilize Redshift's system tables (e.g., `STL_QUERY` or `STL_WLM_QUERY`) to count the total number of queries submitted in the previous month.
   - Create a SQL query to retrieve this count.
   - Integrate this query into the same script used for the disk and CPU utilization report.

4. **User with Maximum Queries:**
   - Extend the SQL query to include user-specific statistics, such as the count of queries submitted by each user.
   - Identify the user with the maximum number of queries using SQL.
   - Include this information in the email report.

5. **Testing and Error Handling:**
   - Test the entire workflow thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to address issues such as query failures or email delivery failures.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the scripts and scheduling mechanisms in an appropriate environment (e.g., AWS EC2 instance, local server).
   - Ensure that necessary permissions are granted for accessing Redshift and sending emails.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Monitor the execution of the scheduled tasks and address any failures promptly.
   - Perform periodic reviews to ensure the reports meet your requirements and make adjustments as necessary.

By following these steps, you can automate the generation and distribution of monthly reports on disk and CPU utilization, total query submissions, and user-specific query statistics from Redshift.
