Subject: Update on Sandbox Infrastructure and Alteryx Production

Hi Chandan,

I trust this message finds you well. Today, we focused on setting up the Sandbox Infrastructure, and I'm pleased to report that Alteryx is now operational. I've generated a few tickets for the upcoming steps in the process. Once these tasks are complete, we can proceed with configuring the sandbox server.

Additionally, I want to inform you that the Alteryx production environment is now up and running smoothly.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
